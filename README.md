## Whither the Weather?

### Use the ~~OpenWeather~~ Weather Underground API to build a weather forecast search tool

- [ ] Pick three types of forecasts to choose from.
- [ ] User inputs zipcode and selects forecast type from a dropdown.
- [ ] Use an XHR to fetch the api data. The syntax will be just like the calls you have written to fetch a local JSON file, only you'll be pulling in remote data. It will return the data in JSON by default.
- [ ] Present the returned data in a nicely styled display. Use an image to accompany the forecast/conditions, such as a cloud with raindrops when the chance for precip is above a certain percentage.
- [ ] The UI should use Bootstrap.
